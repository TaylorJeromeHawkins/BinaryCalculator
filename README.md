# CalculatorProject
I got annoyed having to hit 5 buttons and constantly retyping numbers to convert from different forms of number systems. So I made a calculator where you can type either number type and just toggle between binary, Octal, hexadecimal, and of course decimal. Made in Scenebuilder, coded in Java and styled with CSS.

EvaluateString.java is code from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3422673/how-to-evaluate-a-math-expression-given-in-string-form, which was used to evaluate a string expression.
