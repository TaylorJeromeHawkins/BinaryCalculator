# CalculatorProject
I got annoyed having to hit 5 buttons and constantly retyping numbers to convert from different forms of number systems.

EvaluateString.java is code from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3422673/how-to-evaluate-a-math-expression-given-in-string-form, which is used to evaluate a string expression.
